### AKA the Untitled Movie Review Site
Welcome to the Untitled Movie Review website. The idea for this
project is to offer a new take on movie reviews. To do that, there
are two problems this project aims to provide solutions to.

The first is a better aggregate rating system. The current norm
for rating systems is bland at best, and unhelpful at worst. Users
deserve a better way to see what other people thought of the
movies they're looking up.

The second is a better way to discover new movies. Deciding on a
new movie to watch can be difficult, with potential spoilers
looming behind every review, and too many options to choose.

This project is still in its infancy, so for now those solutions
are just ideas, but hopefully soon they'll be a reality,
